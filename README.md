# Discovery Service

A common service used to find other service endpoints. Kind of like Netflix Eureka, but way less powerful.

By default this service runs on port `3030`, it is recommended that you don't change this setting if possible.

## Quick Start

To run this package, first copy `.env.example` to `.env` by typing the following command

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` file to match your local setup.

Finally, run `npm install && npm start` to run the development environment.
